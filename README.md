# Visma-Booking-Entry
THIS IS MY ENTRY PROJECT FOR "VISMA CODE FOR CASH - EDITION 2 - ONLINE TREASURE HUNT"
THIS C# PROJECT WAS CREATED USING MICROSOFT VISUAL STUDIO 2015 ENTERPRISE.

NOTES:

!!! VERY IMPORTANT !!!
THE DATABASE FILE WAS TOO BIG TO BE UPLOADED HERE, SO JUST DOWNLOAD IT FROM HERE:
AND PASTE IT INTO "\VismaBooking\VismaBooking\bin\Debug\" FOR THE APPLICATION TO WORK PROPERLY
!!! VERY IMPORTANT !!!

THE GUI ISN'T THAT GOOD. I HAVE RECENTLY BEGAN TO LEARN WPF BUT I DIDN'T HAVE ENOUGH TIME TO MASTER IT BEFORE THE CONTEST, SO I USED SOMETHING I WAS MORE COMFORTABLE WITH: WFA.
TO RUN THE APPLICATION, FOLLOW THE PATH "\VismaBooking\VismaBooking\bin\Debug\VismaBooking.exe"
HERE ARE SOME ACCOUNTS FOR TESTING:
misterceo - misterceo
manager1 - manager1
johnnyyy - johnnyyy
willsmith - willsmith

THE PRIORITY ORDER FOR USERS IS
BasicUser < PremiumUser < Manager < CEO
SO THAT EACH USER HAS ACCESS TO MORE TOOLS THAN THE PREVIOUS ONE.
